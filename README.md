# Nvim Plugins

Some custom plugins I've written in Ruby. If they're useful to you, enjoy!

### Plugins

- ConvertHashKeys: converts Ruby hash keys from string to symbol and vice versa.

### Usage

Clone this repo to `~/.config/nvim/rplugin/ruby` and add mappings in your `.vimrc` to any of the plugins you want. Their names can be found in `plugins.rb`. You'll likely need to restart `nvim` for the changes to take affect, though `:UpdateRemotePlugins` may work, too.
